To play the DLC mod, you will need to patch the game yourself using the PvZ1 (Version 1.0.0.1051). This file is not included in this folder, as I do not condone or promote piracy of the game. If you are unfamiliar with the patching process, you can find helpful tutorials for DeltaPatcher online. Additionally, we plan to provide a patch for the Steam version of PvZ1 soon, so you will simply need to purchase the game on Steam to enjoy the Pvz Community DLC Mod.
